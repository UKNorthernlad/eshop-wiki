# FAQ about eShopOnContainers

## Support questions

### Is Visual Studio 2015 supported
Short answer is NO. There are a lot of changes between VS2017 and VS2015 regarding netcore project format (no more `project.json`) and Docker support.

When the project started, VS2017 were not still available, so the project started with VS2015. There is **an old version of the project** that works with VS2015 and Docker. You can find them at: [using the vs2015 tag](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/tree/vs2015) but is currently **not supported**. For more information about this version read the [corresponding wiki section](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/wiki/05.-Setting-up-the-eShopOnContainers-solution-version-based-on-project.json-files-and-Visual-Studio-2015-environment).

### I want to submit a PR

Glad to hear it! We are open to PRs, just keep in mind three (little) things:

1. Ensure that there is no any active development that is targeting your PR. If you find a bug and want to solve it, ensure that there are not any active issue with that bug. We open issues for any bug we found during our testing. If you find an issue with the same bug, probably this bug is in development. **In case of doubt feel free to ask in the issue**. If you don't find the issue, **feel free to open a new one** and just note in the comments that you will address it a upcoming PR.  

2. When submitting a PR, reference the issue that the PRs solves (if any)

3. **All PR must be done against the `dev` branch**. Any PR against `master` won't be accepted (with a few exceptions). This is to avoid merge conflicts between master and dev. Dev is where all development is happening.

### Are Linux or Mac supported?

Yes. For Linux the CLI is supported. For Mac we support both CLI and Visual Studio for Mac. Feel free to report any issue you found using Mac or Linux.

## Bugs or warnings found when compiling the project

### When I run the project (using Visual Studio 2017 or the CLI) I see one or more warnings like "The ESHOP_AZURE_XXXX variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string."

You can ignore those warnings. They're not from VS2017 but from docker-compose. These variables are used to allow eShopOnContainers use external resources (like Redis or SQL Server) from Azure. If they're not set, the `docker-compose.override.yml` file use defaults values that are good when running everything locally. So, the rule is:

* If you run everything locally: No need to setup this variables, and you can forget this warnings
* If you run all or some resources externally (i.e. in Azure) you need to setup this variables. Refer to [https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/blob/master/readme/README.ENV.md](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/blob/master/readme/README.ENV.md) for more information about how to setup them.

### When I run "docker-compose up" I receive an error like ERROR: Service 'xxxxx' failed to build: COPY failed: stat /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-builder123456789/obj/Docker/publish: no such file or directory

This error is produced because some Docker image can't be built. This is because the project is not published. All projects are published in their `obj/Docker/publish` folder. If there is any compilation error, the project won't be published and the corresponding docker image can't be built, and you will receive this error.

**Note**: When you run the project using F5 from VS2017, projects are not published, so you won't receive this error in VS2017.
