# Windows dev machine

## Recommended Hardware requirements:
- 16Gb of memory RAM - Since you need Hyper-V for Docker Community Edition (aka. Docker for Windows/Mac) in order to run the Linux Docker Host and we're also running a SQL Server container and a Redis container. An 8Gb RAM machine might be too tight.

## Software requirements for Windows are:
-	Docker Community Edition (aka. Docker for Windows) - Requires Windows 10 Pro 64 bits and Hyper-V enabled.
-	.NET Core 2.0 SDK
-	(Optional) Visual Studio 2017 15.5 or later – Much better for debugging multi-containers apps

The requirements for VS 2017 are:
Supported Operating Systems	
Visual Studio 2017 will install and run on the following operating systems:
•	Windows 10 version 1507 or higher: Home, Professional, Education, and Enterprise (LTSB is not supported)

•	Windows Server 2016: Standard and Datacenter

•	Windows 8.1 (with Update 2919355): Basic, Professional, and Enterprise

•	Windows Server 2012 R2 (with Update 2919355): Essentials, Standard, Datacenter

•	Windows 7 SP1 (with latest Windows Updates): Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise, Ultimate

However, the requirements for “Docker for Windows” are more restrictive:

**Why is Windows 10 required?**
Docker for Windows uses Windows Hyper-V. While older Windows versions have Hyper-V, their Hyper-V implementations lack features critical for Docker for Windows to work.

Docker for Windows requires 64bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise and Education (1511 November update, Build 10586 or later) and Microsoft **Hyper-V**. 


# Mac dev machine

## Recommended Hardware requirements:
- 16Gb of memory RAM - Since you a VM in the Mac with the Linux Docker host and we're also running a SQL Server container and a Redis container, 8Gb of RAM might not be enough.

## Software requirements for Mac are:
-	Docker Community for Mac (aka. Docker for Mac) - Requires OS X El Capitan 10.11 or newer macOS.
-	.NET Core 2.0 SDK for Mac
-       (Optional) Visual Studio for Mac
-	(Optional) Visual Studio Code for Mac

Docker for Mac requires OS X El Capitan 10.11 or newer macOS release running on a 2010 or newer Mac, with Intel’s hardware support for MMU virtualization.
