eShopOnContainers supports deployment to Kubernetes for simulated production scenarios where you need to scale-out your containers.
Currently, eShopOnContainers supports AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) and ACS-Kuberentes (Azure Container Service for Kuberentes), but we recommend to use AKS as ACS will be deprecated in the future favoring AKS which offers further PaaS features for the cluster's infrastructure, automatic updates/patch on the VMs, etc.
 
Common info for eShopOnContainers on Kuberentes (including both environments, AKS and ACS) is available here:
https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/blob/dev/k8s/README.k8s.md

However, this post is going to focus specifically on AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) deployment.
