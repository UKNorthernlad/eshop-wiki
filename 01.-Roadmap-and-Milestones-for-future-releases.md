## Version 0.1 (ALPHA, current version - Early March 2017)
- Available at the MASTER branch.
- Docker containers with .NET Core and Linux images support/tested. Windows Containers are work-in-progress.
- .NET 1.1 and EF 1.1 support 
- Visual Studio 2017 and .csproj support, including VS Docker Tooling based on docker-compose.yml files supporting multi-container debugging, etc. - CLI and VS Code environments are also supported.
- Initial basic foundational microservice oriented architecture, easy to get started, described in this <a href='docs/architecting-and-developing-containerized-and-microservice-based-net-applications-ebook-early-draft.pdf'>**Guide/eBook** (Early DRAFT, still work in progress)</a>. 

## Version 0.2 Roadmap (BETA, by mid-April 2017 timeframe)

- Implement support for Windows Containers running on Windows NanoServer using different Docker base images instead of the Linux based images (.NET Core code should be the same as it is cross-platform) - Fork or the same repo?

- Build/compile process within an Integration Container (with a provided Docker Image with all SDK dependencies) instead of in local PC. This would greatly simplify the CLI developer's installation requirements in a local machine. That integration container should also be used from a CI pipeline.

- INTEGRATION EVENTS with Event-Bus implementations: Implement Event-Driven communication between microservices/containers based on Event-Bus interfaces and two implementation:
  1. (PRIORITY) Standalone Pub/Subs messaging implementation based on an out-of-proc RabbitMQ Container
  2. (Future version) Azure-attached implementation based on Azure Service Bus using Topics for Pub/Subs
Two integration event scenarios to implement in the app: 
  1. Simple (higher priority): Change Product info (name, image URL, etc.) in the Catalog and update that in the existing Orders and Baskets (all, except the price) 
  2. Complex: Events propagating Order's states changes related to the Order-Process SAGA (InProcess, Paid, Handling, Shipped, Canceled if timeout because it was not paid, etc.) - Scenario to be discussed/defined

- Implement security best practices about app's secrets (conn strings, env vars, etc.)
    (However, this subject depends on the chosen orchestrator...)
    See when using Swarm: https://blog.docker.com/2017/02/docker-secrets-management/

- Monolithic ASP.NET MVC app with public area of the eShop (Home page with catalog-view functionality, basically). As out of band, separate project (same GitHub repo but separate folder and separate solution)

- WebForms client (Catalog Manager/Simple CRUD maintenance): In the Windows Containers fork, implement and add a client ASP.NET WebForms application (running as a Windows Container) consuming the same microservices, as an example of "lift and shift" scenario.
SCENARIO: A simple CRUD edit WebForms app for the Catalog, consuming the Catalog microservice to add/update/delete products. As simple as possible..

- Exception Handling - As an ASP.NET middleware?
Middleware from ASP.NET Core with custom implementation which records specific exceptions depending if it is in production.
Business-Exceptions + Generic-Exception-Handler (ExceptionHandlerHandler)

- Validations with MediatR Decorator - FluentValidation
https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation

- Resiliency:
  1.  Resilient synchronous HTTP communication with retry-loops with circuit-breaker pattern implementations to avoid DDoS initiated from clients (*** This is a priority ***) - Initial implementation with Polly: https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/ OSS lib. 
  2. - Implement "Idempotent" updates at microservices, so the same update (like a Payment or OrderCreation) cannot be executed multiple times. Server must implement operations idempotently. An operation is idempotent if it gets the same result when performed multiple times. Implementing idempotency is domain-specific.
  3.  Gracefully stopping or shutting down microservice instances – Use the new library implemented as an ASP.NET Core middleware, to be provided by the .NET Team (Need to wait for that library)

- DOMAIN EVENTS: Implement Domain Events which is related but not the same as integration events for inter-microservice-communication. Domain Events are initially intended to be used within a specific microservice's Domain, as communicating state changes between Aggregates, although they could derive to Integration Events if what happened in a microservice's domain should impact other additional microservices. 
SCENARIOS TO IMPLEMENT:
  1. Check price change basket vs. catalog when converting to Order: https://github.com/dotnet/eShopOnContainers/issues/38 
  2. Multiple AGGREGATE changes within the same Command-Handler, decoupled by domain events.
  3. Might need Domain events related to the SAGA implementation
See discussion:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/cesardelatorre/2017/02/07/domain-events-vs-integration-events-in-domain-driven-design-and-microservices-architectures/    
Preferred method: Two-phase Domain events (a la Jimmy Bogard):

Reactive Extensions might be useful for events:

We should probably implement Domain Events when implementing the SAGA example plus integration events, so we implement all those things altogether.

- Implement a SAGA example of a long running instance of a business process (similar to a workflow but implemented as a class with state persistence). The business process would be the "Order-Process-Saga" workflow, involving multiple mock services like PaymentGateway, StockChecking, etc. while changing the Order's state until the order is shipped. Then a background job which fakes ordre delivery and changes order states to delivered.  

- Resiliency 2:
- Use a new Health Check Library (Preview) to be provided by the .NET Team. That library provided by the .NET team will provide: A model of healthcheckresults, A Middleware to return ok/bad, A polling service calling the healthchek service and publishing results (open/pluggable to orchestrators, App Insights, etc.)
Our task here will be to use that new lib.

- Topics to Review and document:
   - API versioning Management for microservices. Techniques and things to have into account Related to Chaos Monkey, etc.
   - Solid API contracts (based probably on Swagger, but interoperable with any language and explicit per paramater)

## Future versions - Roadmap (After April 2017)

- Production-Ready Cloud application with Resilient microservices' design and implementation 
   - Gracefully stopping or shutting down microservice instances - Implemented as an ASP.NET Core middleware in the ASP.NET Core pipeline. Drain in-flight requests before stopping the microservice/container process.
   - Implement messaging communication to ensure Commands/Updates' communication success, using queues, etc. plus providing better scalability capabilities.
   - Monitoring/Diagnostics of microservices based on Application Insights with custom perfkeys
   - Service Fabric Stateful Service implementation in the SF branch
   - Additional microservice with data stored in a No-SQL database like Azure Document DB

- Additional Azure cloud scenarios
  1. Azure Functions: Implement an event-driven Azure Function microservice (i.e. grabbing uploaded images and adding a watermark and putting it into Azure blobs)
  2. Azure Storage Blob: Related to the previous feature - Use Azure Blobs to store the Product Images
  3. Azure App Service: Make the monolithic Web app supporting Azure App Service with Docker

- Real time communication: SignalR Hub microservice/container for real-time communication, like notificating something important that just happened to the user. This feature needs to wait for SignalR to be available in .NET Core 2.0 

- Security:
   - Encrypt secrets at configuration files (like in docker-compose.yml). Multiple possibilities, Azure Key Vault or using simple Certificates at container level, Consul, etc.
   - Other "secure-code" practices
   - Encrypt communication with SSL (related to the specific cloud infrastructure being used)

- Implement example of Optimistic Concurrency updates and optimistic concurrency exceptions

- (To be Confirmed) Nancy: Add a Nancy based microservice, also with DocDB, etc.

- (To be Confirmed) Service Fabric and Azure version
Actor model, stateful services, etc.
- (To be Confirmed) Docker Swarm version (on Azure Container Service)
- (To be Confirmed) Mesos DC/OS version (on Azure Container Service)
- (To be Confirmed) Kubernetes version (on Azure Container Service)

- (To be Confirmed) In the Windows Containers fork, implement and add a simple WCF microservice/container implementing any logic like a simulated legacy Payment Gateway, as an example of "lift and shift" scenario.

- (To be Confirmed) Semantic log - Semantic logic - Related to the Azure app version and Application Insight usage
Monitor what microservices are up/down, etc. related to App Insights, but the events are custom
ETW events and "Semantic Application Log" from P&P
Multiple implementations for the storage of the events, Azure Diagnostics, Elastic Search.
Using EventSource base class, etc.

- (To be Confirmed) Composite UI based on microservices.
Including the “UI per microservice”.
