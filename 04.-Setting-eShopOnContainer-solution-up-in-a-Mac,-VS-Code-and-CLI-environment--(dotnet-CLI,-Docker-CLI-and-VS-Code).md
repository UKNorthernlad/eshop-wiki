## Want to try it out on the Mac using the bash shell?

Main steps:
Â 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers.git
$ cd eShopOnContainers
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.build.yml up
$ docker-compose up
```

The first two commands clone the git repository onto your machine, and changes the current directory to the root directory of the project.

The third command, `docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.build.yml up` creates a Docker container based on an image used for Continuous Integration (CI) builds. That image has all the required SDKs and tools loaded on it. These include .NET Core, the .NET Core CLI and SDK, npm, and required npm packages. Once the container starts, it will mount your source directory as a shared drive, then build and publish all the projects that make up the eShopOnContainers application.

The final command `docker-compose up` pulls all the base Docker images needed, creates the images for each microservice, then launches each container that makes up the application.

Once the containers have launched, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5100` to visit the MVC application:

## Detailed procedure - Setting eShopOnContainers up in a CLI and Windows based development machine
This CLI environment means that you want to build/run by using the CLI (Command line interface) available in .NET Core (dotnetcore) and Docker CLI.
<p>
You don't need Visual Studio 2017 for this environment but can use any code editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime, etc. Of course, you could still use VS 2017 at the same time, as well.

### GitHub branch to use/pull
By default, use the MASTER branch which supports .CSPROJ projects and .NET Core 1.1 CLI and Docker CLI. The same branch's code supports Visual Studio 2017 or CLI scenarios, simultaneously, depending on each developer's preference.
