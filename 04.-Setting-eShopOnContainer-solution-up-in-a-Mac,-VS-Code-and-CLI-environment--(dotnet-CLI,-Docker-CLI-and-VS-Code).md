# Try it out on the Mac using the bash shell

The quickest path to get eShopOnContainers running on your Mac:

## Prerequisites

1. A Git client. The [git-scm site](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac) maintains a great list of clients.
1. [Docker for Macintosh](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). The stable channel is fine.
1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). The stable channel is fine as well.
1. [.NET Core and SDK](http://dot.net). Install the SDK and runtime.

The SQL images require more memory to run. You will need to update your Docker settings to allocate at least 4 GB of memory:

Depending on how many apps you are running in your Mac you might need to assign more memory to Docker in the Mac. Usually, 4GB should suffice, but we got feedback from devs who needed to assign up to 8GB of ram to Docker in the Mac.

## Building the application

Then, open a bash shell and run the fullowing four commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers.git
$ cd eShopOnContainers
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.build.yml up
$ docker-compose up
```

The first two commands clone the git repository onto your machine, and changes the current directory to the root directory of the project.

The third command, `docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.build.yml up` creates a Docker container based on an image used for Continuous Integration (CI) builds. That image has all the required SDKs and tools loaded on it. These include .NET Core, the .NET Core CLI and SDK, npm, and required npm packages. Once the container starts, it will mount your source directory as a shared drive, then build and publish all the projects that make up the eShopOnContainers application.

The final command `docker-compose up` pulls all the base Docker images needed, creates the images for each microservice, then launches each container that makes up the application.

## Running the application 

Once the containers have launched, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5100` to visit the MVC application:

[[img/eShopOnContainersHomePage.png]]

You can also try the SPA style application by navigating to `http://localhost:5104`. Here are where all the 
services can be reached:

    - *MVC Application*: `http://localhost:5100`
    - *SPA Application*: `http://localhost:5105`
    - *Health Status*: `http://localhost:5107`
    - *Catalog Microservice API*: `http://localhost:5101`
    - *Ordering Microservice API*: `http://localhost:5102`
    - *Basket Microservice API*: `http://localhost:5103`
    - *Identity Microservice API*: `http://localhost:5105`

## Detailed procedure - Setting eShopOnContainers up using bash and a Mac development machine

The quick instructions above build all the projects that make up eShopOnContainers in a Docker
container. That's the preferred way to build the application. It's easier to make sure all the
prerequisites are installed, every developer uses the same version of all the tools, and
you have a consistent experience from any build.

### GitHub branch to use/pull

Use the `master` branch from the eShopOnContainers project. It is the most up to date stable
branch.

However, if you want to look at the very latest features, use the `dev` branch. If you
want to submit pull requests for eShopOnContainers, start from the `dev` branch and target
your PR to that branch.

The recommended approach is to build the .NET bits and Docker images by using an special build
container from the CLI or your CI/CD pipeline. What you run and test locally is built using the
same process as your CI/CD pipleine. The verions of all tools are the same, the same version of
all SDKs are used, and so on. This ensures consistency across all builds.

<img src="img/building-bits_from_ci_container.png">

The build container to use is based on the `image: microsoft/aspnetcore-build` ASP.NET Core
build image which includes the .NET SDK, NPM and many other Web and ASP.NET dependencies
(Gulp, Bower, NPM, etc.) to build your services and web apps.

Contrast the four commands you ran above, along with the minimal prerequisites, with the
list of prerequisites and tools needed to build locally on your machine.

## Setting up docker-compose file

The Mac has a changing IP address (or none if you have no network access). From 17.06 onwards our recommendation is to connect to the special Mac-only DNS name docker.for.mac.localhost which will resolve to the internal IP address used by the host.

Therefore, the following change must be done in docker-compose.override.yml.
In the WebMVC service section, replace the IdentityUrl environment variable with:

 ```bash
    IdentityUrl=http://docker.for.mac.localhost:5105
 ```
The WebMVC service definition should finally be configured as shown bellow:

 ```bash
    webmvc:
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:80
      - CatalogUrl=http://catalog.api
      - OrderingUrl=http://ordering.api
      - BasketUrl=http://basket.api
      - IdentityUrl=http://docker.for.mac.localhost:5105
      - MarketingUrl=http://marketing.api  #Local:  Use 10.0.75.1 in a "Docker for Windows" environment, if using "localhost" from browser. 
                                                 #Remote: Use ${ESHOP_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP} if using external IP or DNS name from browser. 
      - UseCustomizationData=True
    ports:
      - "5100:80"
 ```

## Building the application locally

You can build the application using your machien, if you prefer.  You'll need the following
prerequisites installed, in addition to those listed above for building using the CI container.

    - *[.NET Core and SDK](http://dot.net)*
    - *[Node and NPM](http://nodejs.org)*

Install the following software versions:

    - .NET Core 1.1 (1.1.2 with SDK 1.0.4 (Promoted to LTS)) https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.1.2-download.md
    - NodeJS 6.11.1

 We've included a bash script that runs all the build commands locally. Navigate to your
 eShopOnContainers directory, and cd into the *cli-mac* directory. Then, run the build script:

 ```bash
 $ ./build-bits.sh
 ```

 The script runs a restore, build, and publish for each project using the `dotnet` CLI tool.
 In addition, it runs the client build commands using *npm* to build the SPA application
 assets. Finally, it will remove old docker containers and images.

After you've finished the build, you can create the necessary containers using
`docker-compose`:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

The above command creates the images for the eShopOnContainers application. To run, you
use `docker-compose` again:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

The first time you run this command, it will pull the necessary docker images
from Docker hub. That will take some time. Once the images have been pulled,
the application will start and you can test it out using the browser and the
addresses shown [above](#running-the-application).
