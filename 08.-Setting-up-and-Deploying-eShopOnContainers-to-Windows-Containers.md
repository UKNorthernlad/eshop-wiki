This is a draft page which will be evolving while our tests and dev regarding Windows Containers are completed.
eShopOncontainers on Windows Containers is still under tests at the **windows-containers-test** branch.

For now, we're just adding the current "Windows Containers" support.

Windows Containers support:

**Windows Server 2016** - Production Environments
- Install **Docker Enterprise Edition** (Docker EE)
- Designed to run apps in production
- Call Microsoft for support. If it's a Docker rather than Windows problem, they escalate to Docker and get it solved

**Windows 10** - Dev Environments
- Install **Docker Community Edition** (Docker CE, formerly **Docker for Windows**)
- Support via forums/GitHub
- Can switch between Windows container development and Linux (in VM). There is no plan to drop either OS from Docker CE
- Designed for devs only. Not production

Docker might provide per incident support system for Docker Community Edition, or provide a "EE Desktop" for developers, but it's their call to do so. Not Microsoft's.
