This is a draft page which will be evolving while our tests and dev regarding Windows Containers are completed.
eShopOncontainers on Windows Containers is still under tests at the **windows-containers-test** branch.

For now, we're just adding the current "Windows Containers" support.

Windows Containers support:

**Windows Server 2016** - Production Environments
- Install **[Docker Enterprise Edition](https://store.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-server-windows?tab=description)** (Docker EE)
- Designed to run apps in production
- Call Microsoft for support. If it's a Docker rather than Windows problem, they escalate to Docker and get it solved

**Windows 10** - Dev Environments
- Install **[Docker Community Edition](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows?tab=description)** (Docker CE, formerly **Docker for Windows**)
- Support via forums/GitHub
- Can switch between Windows container development and Linux (in VM). There is no plan to drop either OS from Docker CE
- Designed for devs only. Not production

Docker might provide per incident support system for Docker Community Edition, or provide a "EE Desktop" for developers, but it's their call to do so. Not Microsoft's.

## Set Docker to use Windows Container (Windows 10 only)

In Windows 10 you need to set Docker to use "Windows container" instead of Linux containers (in Windows Server 2016 Windows Containers are used by default). To do this, first you must have enabled container support in Windows 10. In "Turn Windows features on/off" select "Containers":
