# Using Helm Charts to deploy eShopOnContainers to AKS

It is possible to deploy eShopOnContainers on a AKS using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) instead of custom scripts (that will be deprecated soon).

## Create Kubernetes cluster in AKS
You can create the AKS cluster by using two ways:

- Use Azure CLI: Follow a procedure suing [Azure CLI like here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough), but make sure you enable RBAC.

- Use Azure's portal

The following steps are using the Azure portal to create the AKS cluster:

- Start the process by providing the general data, like in the following screenshot:

- Then, very important, in the next step, enable RBAC:

- You can use basic network settings since for a test you don't need integration into any existing VNET:

- You can also enable monitoring:

- Finally, in order NOT to get errors in the Kubernetes dashboard like the following, you'll need to set the following service-account steps.

- Because the cluster is using RBAC, you need to grant needed rights to the Service Account `kubernetes-dashboard`:

`kubectl create clusterrolebinding kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:kubernetes-dashboard`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/45785562-a69c3d80-bc21-11e8-99fa-60298fc03fbe.png)

Now, just run the Azure CLI command to browse the Kubernetes Dashboard:

`az aks browse --resource-group pro-eshop-aks-helm-linux-resgrp --name pro-eshop-aks-helm-linux`

## Additional pre-requisites

In addition to having an AKS cluster created in Azure and having kubectl and Azure CLI installed in your local machine and configured to use your Azure subscription, you also need the following pre-requisites:

### Install Helm 

You need to have helm installed on your machine, and Tiller must be installed on the AKS. Follow these instructions on how to ['Install applications with Helm in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-helm) to setup Helm and Tiller for AKS.

**Note**: If your ASK cluster is not RBAC-enabled (default option in portal) you may receive following error when running a helm command:

```
Error: Get http://localhost:8080/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/configmaps?labelSelector=OWNER%!D(MISSING)TILLER: dial tcp [::1]:8080: connect: connection refused
```

If so, type:

```
kubectl --namespace=kube-system edit deployment/tiller-deploy
```

Your default text editor will popup with the YAML definition of the tiller deploy. Search for:

```
automountServiceAccountToken: false
```

And change it to:

```
automountServiceAccountToken: true
```

Save the file and close the editor. This should reapply the deployment in the cluster. Now Helm commands should work.

### AKS created with _http routing_ enabled (optional but recommended)

If creating AKS using CLI be sure to use `--enable-addons http_application_routing` in `az aks create` command. If using Azure Portal just be sure to check the checkbox "Http application routing" on "Networking" settings. For more info, read the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/http-application-routing)

## Install eShopOnContainers using Helm

All steps need to be performed on `/k8s/helm` folder. The easiest way is to use the `deploy-all.ps1` script from a Powershell window:

```
.\deploy-all.ps1 -externalDns aks -aksName eshoptest -aksRg eshoptest -imageTag dev
```

This will install all the [eShopOnContainers public images](https://hub.docker.com/u/eshop/) with tag `dev` on the AKS named `eshoptest` in the resource group `eshoptest`. By default all infrastructure (sql, mongo, rabbit and redis) is installed also in the cluster.

Once the script is run, you should see following output when using `kubectl get deployment`:

```

```

Every public service is exposed through its own ingress resource, as you can see if using `kubectl get ing`:

```
eshop-apigwmm        eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-apigwms        eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-apigwwm        eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-apigwws        eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-identity-api   eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-webmvc         eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-webspa         eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-webstatus      eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
```

Ingresses are automatically configured to use the public DNS of the AKS provided by the "https routing" addon.

You can view the MVC client at http://<dns>/webmvc and the SPA at the http://<dns>/

## Customizing the deployment

### Using your own images

To use your own images instead of the public ones, you have to pass following additional parameters to the `deploy-all.ps1` script:

* `registry`: Login server for the Docker registry
* `dockerUser`: User login for the Docker registry
* `dockerPassword`: User password for the Docker registry

This will deploy a secret on the cluster to connect to the specified server, and all image names deployed will be prepended with `registry/` value.

### Using specific DNS

The `-externalDns` parameter controls the DNS bounded to ingresses. You can pass a custom DNS (like `my.server.com`), or the `aks` value to autodiscover the AKS DNS. For autodiscover to work you also need to pass which AKS is, using the `-aksName` and `-aksRg` parameters.
Autodiscovering works using Azure CLI under the hood, so ensure that Azure CLI is logged and pointing to the right subscription.

If you don't pass any external DNS at all, ingresses are'nt bound to any DNS, and you have to use public IP to access the resources.

### Not deploying infrastructure containers

If you want to use external resources, use `-deployInfrastructure $false` to not deploy infrastructure containers. However **you still have to manually update the scripts to provide your own configuration** (see next section).

### Providing your own configuration

The file `inf.yaml` contains the description of the infrastructure used. File is docummented so take a look on it to understand all of its entries. If using external resources you need to edit this file according to your needs. You'll need to edit:

* `inf.sql.host` with the host name of the SQL Server
* `inf.sql.common` entries to provide your SQL user, password. `Pid` is not used when using external resources (it is used to set specific product id for the SQL Server container).
* `inf.sql.catalog`, `inf.sql.ordering`, `inf.sql.identity`: To provide the database names for catalog, ordering and identity services
* `mongo.host`: With the host name of the Mongo DB
* `mongo.locations`, `mongo.marketing` with the database names for locations and marketing services
* `redis.basket.constr` with the connection string to Redis for Basket Service. Note that `redis.basket.svc` is not used when using external services
* `redis.keystore.constr` with the connection string to Redis for Keystore Service. Note that `redis.keystore.svc` is not used when using external services
* `eventbus.constr` with the connection string to Azure Service Bus and `eventbus.useAzure` to `true` to use Azure service bus. Note that `eventbus.svc` is not used when using external services

### Using Azure storage for Catalog Photos

Using Azure storage for catalog (and marketing) photos is not directly supported, but you can accomplish it by editing the file `k8s/helm/catalog-api/templates/configmap.yaml`. Search for lines:

```
catalog__PicBaseUrl: http://{{ $webshoppingapigw }}/api/v1/c/catalog/items/[0]/pic/
```

And replace it for:

```
catalog__PicBaseUrl: http://<url-of-the-storage>/
```

In the same way, to use Azure storage for the marketing service, have to edit the file `k8s/helm/marketing-api/templates/configmap.yaml` and replacing the line:

```
marketing__PicBaseUrl: http://{{ $webshoppingapigw }}/api/v1/c/catalog/items/[0]/pic/
```

by:

```
marketing__PicBaseUrl: http://<url-of-the-storage>/
```
