# Using Helm Charts to deploy eShopOnContainers to AKS

It is possible to deploy eShopOnContainers on a AKS using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) instead of custom scripts (that will be deprecated soon).

## Pre-requisites

Despite an AKS created and kubectl and Azure CLI installed and configured to use your subscription, there are also following pre-requisites:

### Installing helm

You need to have helm installed on your machine, and Tiller must be installed on the AKS. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/aks/kubernetes-helm.md) to setup Helm and Tiller for AKS

### AKS created with _http routing_ enabled (optional but recommended)

If creating AKS using CLI be sure to use `--enable-addons http_application_routing` in `az aks create` command. If using Azure Portal just be sure to check the checkbox "Http application routing" on "Networking" settings. For more info, read the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/http-application-routing)

## Install eShopOnContainers using Helm

All steps need to be performed on `/k8s/helm` folder. The easiest way is to use the `deploy-all.ps1` script from a Powershell window:

```
.\deploy-all.ps1 -externalDns aks -aksName eshoptest -aksRg eshoptest -imageTag dev
```

This will install all the [eShopOnContainers public images](https://hub.docker.com/u/eshop/) with tag `dev` on the AKS named `eshoptest` in the resource group `eshoptest`. By default all infrastructure (sql, mongo, rabbit and redis) is installed also in the cluster.

Once the script is run, you should see following output when using `kubectl get deployment`:

```

Every public service is exposed through its own ingress resource, as you can see if using `kubectl get ing`:

```
eshop-apigwmm        eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-apigwms        eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-apigwwm        eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-apigwws        eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-identity-api   eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-webmvc         eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-webspa         eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
eshop-webstatus      eshop.<your-guid>.<region>.aksapp.io   <public-ip>   80        4d
```

Ingresses are automatically configured to use the public DNS of the AKS provided by the "https routing" addon.

You can view the MVC client at http://<dns>/webmvc and the SPA at the http://<dns>/

## Customizing the deployment

### Using your own images

To use your own images instead of the public ones, you have to pass following additional parameters to the `deploy-all.ps1` script:

* `registry`: Login server for the Docker registry
* `dockerUser`: User login for the Docker registry
* `dockerPassword`: User password for the Docker registry

This will deploy a secret on the cluster to connect to the specified server, and all image names deployed will be prepended with `registry/` value.

### Using specific DNS

The `-externalDns` parameter controls the DNS bounded to ingresses. You can pass a custom DNS (like `my.server.com`), or the `aks` value to autodiscover the AKS DNS. For autodiscover to work you also need to pass which AKS is, using the `-aksName` and `-aksRg` parameters.
Autodiscovering works using Azure CLI under the hood, so ensure that Azure CLI is logged and pointing to the right subscription.

If you don't pass any external DNS at all, ingresses are'nt bound to any DNS, and you have to use public IP to access the resources.

### Not deploying infrastructure containers

If you want to use external resources, use `-deployInfrastructure $false` to not deploy infrastructure containers. However **you still have to manually update the scripts to provide your own configuration** (see next section).

### Providing your own configuration

The file `inf.yaml` contains the description of the infrastructure used. File is docummented so take a look on it to understand all of its entries. If using external resources you need to edit this file according to your needs. You'll need to edit:

* `inf.sql.host` with the host name of the SQL Server
* `inf.sql.common` entries to provide your SQL user, password. `Pid` is not used when using external resources (it is used to set specific product id for the SQL Server container).
* `inf.sql.catalog`, `inf.sql.ordering`, `inf.sql.identity`: To provide the database names for catalog, ordering and identity services
* `mongo.host`: With the host name of the Mongo DB
* `mongo.locations`, `mongo.marketing` with the database names for locations and marketing services
* `redis.basket.constr` with the connection string to Redis for Basket Service. Note that `redis.basket.svc` is not used when using external services
* `redis.keystore.constr` with the connection string to Redis for Keystore Service. Note that `redis.keystore.svc` is not used when using external services
* `eventbus.constr` with the connection string to Azure Service Bus and `eventbus.useAzure` to `true` to use Azure service bus. Note that `eventbus.svc` is not used when using external services

### Using Azure storage for Catalog Photos

Using Azure storage for catalog (and marketing) photos is not directly supported, but you can accomplish it by editing the file `k8s/helm/catalog-api/templates/configmap.yaml`. Search for lines:

```
catalog__PicBaseUrl: http://{{ $webshoppingapigw }}/api/v1/c/catalog/items/[0]/pic/
```

And replace it for:

```
catalog__PicBaseUrl: http://<url-of-the-storage>/
```

In the same way, to use Azure storage for the marketing service, have to edit the file `k8s/helm/marketing-api/templates/configmap.yaml` and replacing the line:

```
marketing__PicBaseUrl: http://{{ $webshoppingapigw }}/api/v1/c/catalog/items/[0]/pic/
```

by:

```
marketing__PicBaseUrl: http://<url-of-the-storage>/
```
