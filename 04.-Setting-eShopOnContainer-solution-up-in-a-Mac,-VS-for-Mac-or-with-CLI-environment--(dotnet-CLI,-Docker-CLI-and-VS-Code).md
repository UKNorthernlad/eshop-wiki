# Global prerequisite: Docker for Mac

Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). The stable channel is fine.

## Configure Docker for Mac

### Docker for Mac (Linux VM) memory assigned
The SQL Server image for Docker requires more memory to run. You will need to update your Docker settings to allocate at least 4 GB of memory:

Depending on how many apps you are running in your Mac you might need to assign more memory to Docker in the Mac. Usually, 4GB should suffice, but we got feedback from devs who needed to assign up to 8GB of ram to Docker in the Mac.

### Folder shares in Docker for Mac
If your projects are placed within the /Users folder, you don't need to configure anything additional, as that is a pre-shared folder. However, if you place your projects under a different path, like /MyRootProjects, then you'd need to add that shared folder to Docker's configuration, here:

# Option A: Use Visual Studio for Mac
The quickest path to get eShopOnContainers running on your Mac is by using VS for Mac which will install most of the pre-requisites you need.

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). (You should already have this installed)
1. [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/).

## Install Visual Studio for Mac

When installing [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), you can select between multiple workloads or platforms.

Make sure you select the .NET Core platform:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/32018392-951e1bce-b97e-11e7-946c-94ae9269c5f8.png)

Before completing the VS for Mac installation, it will demand you to install XCode, that is needed for multiple dependencies. 

If you install Android as a target platform, Java will also be installed as a dependency for building mobile apps for Android.

For running just the Docker containers and web apps, you'd just need the .NET Core platform.

But if you want to try the eShopOnContainers mobile app, that requires Xamarin and therefore, the iOS and Android platforms, too. Those mobile platforms are optional for this Wiki walkthrough, though. 

## Clone the eShopOnContainers repo

Open a bash shell and run the following command:

```
$ mkdir MyGitRepos
$ cd MyGitRepos
$ git clone https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers.git
$ cd eShopOnContainers
```

With that, you'll have the code at /Users/yourUser/MyGitRepos/eShopOnContainers folder.

## Open the "eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln" solution with VS for Mac

Run Visual Studio for Mac and open the solution `eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln`.

If you just want to run the containers/microservices and web apps, do NOT open the other solutions, like `eShopOnContainers.sln` as those solutions will also open the Xamarin projects and that might slow you down when testing due to additional dependencies in VS.

After opening the `eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln` solution for the first time, it is recommended to wait for a few minutes as VS will be restoring many NuGet packages and the solution won't be able to compile or run until it gets all the nuGet packages dependencies, in the first place (this time is only needed the first time you open the solution. Next times it is a lot faster).

This is VS for Mac with the `eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln` solution. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/32020102-f691b96a-b983-11e7-8960-32e2e2968d3e.png)

## Run eShopOnContainers from VS for Mac (F5 or Ctrl+F5)

Make sure that the by default start-up project is the Docker project named `docker-compose`.

Hit Ctrl+F5 or press the "play" button in VS for Mac.

IMPORTANT: The first time you run eShopOnContainers, it will take longer than the next time you launch it. Under the covers, Docker is pulling quite a few "heavy" images from Docker Hub (the public image registry), like the SQL Server image, Redis image, RabbitMQ image and the base ASP.NET Core images. That pull/download process will take a few minutes. Then, VS will launch the application custom containers plus the infrastructure containers (SQL, Redis, RabbitMQ and MongoDB), populate sample data in the databases and finally run the microservices and web apps on custom containers.

Note that you will see normal/controlled Http exceptions caused by our retries with exponential backoff, as the web apps have to wait until the microservices are ready for the first time which need first to run SQL sentences populating sample data, etc. 

Once the solution is up and running, you should be able to see it in the browser at:

http://localhost:5100

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1712635/32020661-cfbfe4ea-b985-11e7-8c03-cf313130be70.png)

IMPORTANT: In order to have the full app working, like being able to login with a user and add items to the basket and create orders, or being able to consume the services from a remote Xamarin or web SPA, you need to configure additional steps for the app, like the IP to be used by the Identity Service because it needs to be redirected, etc. - Check the additional configuration below.


# Option B: Use a CLI environment (dotnet CLI, Docker CLI with the bash shell) and VS Code as plain editor

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). You should already have this.
1. A Git client. The [git-scm site](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac) maintains a great list of clients.
1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). The stable channel is fine as well.
1. [.NET Core and SDK](http://dot.net). Install the SDK and runtime.
1. Bower and other dependencies needed by the MVC and SPA web apps

## Building the application

Then, open a bash shell and run the following four commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers.git
$ cd eShopOnContainers
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.build.yml up
$ docker-compose up
```

The first two commands clone the git repository onto your machine, and changes the current directory to the root directory of the project.

The third command, `docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.build.yml up` creates a Docker container based on an image used for Continuous Integration (CI) builds. That image has all the required SDKs and tools loaded on it. These include .NET Core, the .NET Core CLI and SDK, npm, and required npm packages. Once the container starts, it will mount your source directory as a shared drive, then build and publish all the projects that make up the eShopOnContainers application.

The final command `docker-compose up` pulls all the base Docker images needed, creates the images for each microservice, then launches each container that makes up the application.

## Running the application 

Once the containers have launched, open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5100` to visit the MVC application:

[[img/eShopOnContainersHomePage.png]]

You can also try the SPA style application by navigating to `http://localhost:5104`. Here are where all the 
services can be reached:

    - *MVC Application*: `http://localhost:5100`
    - *SPA Application*: `http://localhost:5105`
    - *Health Status*: `http://localhost:5107`
    - *Catalog Microservice API*: `http://localhost:5101`
    - *Ordering Microservice API*: `http://localhost:5102`
    - *Basket Microservice API*: `http://localhost:5103`
    - *Identity Microservice API*: `http://localhost:5105`

To add items to the shopping cart or check out, you'll need to login to the site.

## Detailed procedure - Setting eShopOnContainers up using bash and a Mac development machine

The quick instructions above build all the projects that make up eShopOnContainers in a Docker
container. That's the preferred way to build the application. It's easier to make sure all the
prerequisites are installed, every developer uses the same version of all the tools, and
you have a consistent experience from any build.

### GitHub branch to use/pull

Use the `master` branch from the eShopOnContainers project. It is the most up to date stable
branch.

However, if you want to look at the very latest features, use the `dev` branch. If you
want to submit pull requests for eShopOnContainers, start from the `dev` branch and target
your PR to that branch.

The recommended approach is to build the .NET bits and Docker images by using an special build
container from the CLI or your CI/CD pipeline. What you run and test locally is built using the
same process as your CI/CD pipleine. The verions of all tools are the same, the same version of
all SDKs are used, and so on. This ensures consistency across all builds.

<img src="img/building-bits_from_ci_container.png">

The build container to use is based on the `image: microsoft/aspnetcore-build` ASP.NET Core
build image which includes the .NET SDK, NPM and many other Web and ASP.NET dependencies
(Gulp, Bower, NPM, etc.) to build your services and web apps.

Contrast the four commands you ran above, along with the minimal prerequisites, with the
list of prerequisites and tools needed to build locally on your machine.

## Setting up docker-compose file

The Mac has a changing IP address (or none if you have no network access). From 17.06 onwards our recommendation is to connect to the special Mac-only DNS name docker.for.mac.localhost which will resolve to the internal IP address used by the host.

Therefore, the following change must be done in docker-compose.override.yml.
In the WebMVC service section, replace the IdentityUrl environment variable with:

 ```bash
    IdentityUrl=http://docker.for.mac.localhost:5105
 ```
The WebMVC service definition should finally be configured as shown bellow:

 ```bash
    webmvc:
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:80
      - CatalogUrl=http://catalog.api
      - OrderingUrl=http://ordering.api
      - BasketUrl=http://basket.api
      - IdentityUrl=http://docker.for.mac.localhost:5105
      - MarketingUrl=http://marketing.api  #Local:  Use 10.0.75.1 in a "Docker for Windows" environment, if using "localhost" from browser. 
                                                 #Remote: Use ${ESHOP_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP} if using external IP or DNS name from browser. 
      - UseCustomizationData=True
    ports:
      - "5100:80"
 ```

## Building the application locally

You can build the application using your machien, if you prefer.  You'll need the following
prerequisites installed, in addition to those listed above for building using the CI container.

    - *[.NET Core and SDK](http://dot.net)*
    - *[Node and NPM](http://nodejs.org)*

Install the following software versions:

    - .NET Core 1.1 (1.1.2 with SDK 1.0.4 (Promoted to LTS)) https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/1.1.2-download.md
    - NodeJS 6.11.1

 Ensure you are using the lastest version of node packages such us angular-cli 1.3.0 or you will receive some errors when 
 you run docker-compose -f docker-compose.ci.build.yml up because the command npm run build:prod will fail.

 We've included a bash script that runs all the build commands locally. Navigate to your
 eShopOnContainers directory, and cd into the *cli-mac* directory. Then, run the build script:

 ```bash
 $ ./build-bits.sh
 ```

 The script runs a restore, build, and publish for each project using the `dotnet` CLI tool.
 In addition, it runs the client build commands using *npm* to build the SPA application
 assets. Finally, it will remove old docker containers and images.

After you've finished the build, you can create the necessary containers using
`docker-compose`:

```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

The above command creates the images for the eShopOnContainers application. To run, you
use `docker-compose` again:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

The first time you run this command, it will pull the necessary docker images
from Docker hub. That will take some time. Once the images have been pulled,
the application will start and you can test it out using the browser and the
addresses shown [above](#running-the-application).
