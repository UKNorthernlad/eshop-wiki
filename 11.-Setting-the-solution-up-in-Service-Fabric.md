### - Deploying eShopOncontainers as Windows Containers to Azure Service Fabric

In order to deploy eShopOnContainers as Windows Containers an Azure SF environment must be first set. There is available an ARM template to do that job in the following link [SF Win ARM deployment](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/tree/eShopOnServiceFabric-Win/deploy/az/servicefabric/WindowsContainers). Follow the steps in [create SF](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/blob/eShopOnServiceFabric-Win/deploy/az/servicefabric/WindowsContainers/readme.md). 
The ARM script will generate all the necessary Azure resources to publish eShopOnContainers as windows containers.

Once the SF resources have been successfully created, the next step is to publish the SF projects. These projects are under the directory [SF Directory](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers/tree/eShopOnServiceFabric-Win/ServiceFabric) and contains all the xml config files needed to configure and publish eShopOnContainers. SF is composed by 4 SF apps:

- eShopOnServiceFabric: contains all the api services consumed by eShop.
- eShopOnServiceFabricIdSrv: contains the Identity server for authentication.
- eShopOnServiceFabricWebMVC: contains the MVC web app.
- eShopOnServiceFabricWebSPA: containes the SPA web app.
- eShopOnServiceFabricWebStatus: contains the web app for service health checking.

Before deploying, replace **ALL** the external urls in the cloud.xml config file of each SF app which reference the SF dns name with the dns name of your SF. Example:

<img src="img/sf/cloud-config-spa.png">

To deploy the SF apps, open the eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln with vs2017 (Service Fabric SDK installation must be installed) and right-click on each SF project selecting the publish button.

A new window will be prompted allowing you to select the SF cluster you have previously created.

Open the SF explorer page to check out the deployment and healthcheck status.
