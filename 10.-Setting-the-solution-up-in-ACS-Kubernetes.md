# Introduction to Kubernetes and ACS (Azure Container Service)

## Azure Container Service (ACS)
Azure Container Service makes it simpler for you to create, configure, and manage a cluster of virtual machines that are preconfigured to run containerized applications (based on Docker container format), in Azure. 
ACS uses an optimized configuration of popular open-source scheduling and orchestration tools such as KUBERNETES, DOCKER SWARM and Mesosphere DC/OS, so you can you can scale these applications to thousands of containers.
In this case, targeting Kubernetes, ACS is basically the infrastructure in Azure where you create your Kubernetes cluster.

## Docker and Kubernetes
Docker helps you package applications into images, and execute them in containers. Kubernetes is a robust orchestrator platform for containerized applications. It abstracts away the underlying network infrastructure and hardware required to run them, simplifying their deployment, scaling, and management.

## Kubernetes from the container up
### Pods
The basic unit of a Kubernetes deployment is the **Pod**. A Pod encapsulates one or more containers. For example, the `basket` Pod specifies two containers:
>`deployments.yaml`
>
>The first container runs the `eshop/basket.api` image:
>```yaml
>spec:
>  containers:
>  - name: basket
>    image: eshop/basket.api
>    env:
>    - name: ConnectionString
>      value: 127.0.0.1
>```
>Note the `ConnectionString` environment variable: containers within a Pod are networked via `localhost`. The second container runs the `redis` image:
>```yaml
>- name: basket-data
>  image: redis:3.2-alpine
>  ports:
>  - containerPort: 6379
>```
Placing `basket` and `basket-data` in the same Pod is reasonable here because the former requires the latter, and owns all its data. If we wanted to scale the service, however, it would be better to place the containers in separate Pods because the basket API and redis scale at different rates.

If the containers were in separate Pods, they would no longer be able to communicate via `localhost`; a **Service** would be required.

### Services
Services expose Pods to external networks. For example, the `basket` Service exposes Pods with labels `app=eshop` and `component=basket` to the cluster at large:
>`services.yaml`
>```yaml
>kind: Service
>metadata:
>  ...
>  name: basket
>spec:
>  ports:
>  - port: 80
>  selector:
>    app: eshop
>    component: basket
>```
Kubernetes's built-in DNS service resolves Service names to cluster-internal IP addresses. This allows the nginx frontend to proxy connections to the app's microservices by name:
>`nginx.conf`
>```
>location /basket-api {
>    proxy_pass http://basket;
>```
The frontend Pod is different in that it needs to be exposed outside the cluster. This is accomplished with another Service:
>`frontend.yaml`
>```yaml
>spec:
>  ports:
>  - port: 80
>    targetPort: 8080
>  selector:
>    app: eshop
>    component: frontend
>  type: LoadBalancer
>```
`type: LoadBalancer` tells Kubernetes to expose the Service behind a load balancer appropriate for the cluster's platform. For Azure Container Service, this creates an Azure load balancer rule with a public IP.

### Deployments
Kubernetes uses Pods to organize containers, and Services to network them. It uses **Deployments** to organize creating, and modifying, Pods. A Deployment describes a state of one or more Pods. When a Deployment is created or modified, Kubernetes attempts to realize that state.

The Deployments in this project are basic. Still, `deploy.ps1` shows some more advanced Deployment capabilities. For example, Deployments can be paused. Each Deployment of this app is paused at creation:
>`deployments.yaml`
>```yaml
>kind: Deployment
>spec:
>  paused: true
>```
This allows the deployment script to change images before Kubernetes creates the Pods:
>`deploy.ps1`
>```powershell
>kubectl set image -f deployments.yaml basket=$registry/basket.api ...
>kubectl rollout resume -f deployments.yaml
>```

### ConfigMaps
A **ConfigMap** is a collection of key/value pairs commonly used to provide configuration information to Pods. The deployment script uses one to store the frontend's configuration:
>`deploy.ps1`
>```
>kubectl create configmap config-files from-file=nginx-conf=nginx.conf
>```
This creates a ConfigMap named `config-files` with key `nginx-conf` whose value is the content of nginx.conf. The frontend Pod mounts that value as `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
>`frontend.yaml`
>```yaml
>spec:
>  containers:
>  - name: nginx
>  ...
>  volumeMounts:
>  - name: config
>    mountPath: /etc/nginx
>  volumes:
>  - name: config
>    configMap:
>      name: config-files
>      items:
>      - key: nginx-conf
>        path: nginx.conf
>```
This facilitates rapid iteration better than other techniques, e.g. building an image to bake in configuration.

The script also stores public URLs for the app's components in a ConfigMap:
>`deploy.ps1`
>```powershell
>kubectl create configmap urls --from-literal=BasketUrl=http://$($frontendUrl)/basket-api ...
>```
>Here's how the `webspa` Deployment uses it:
>
>`deployments.yaml`
>```yaml
>spec:
>  containers:
>  - name: webspa
>    ...
>    env:
>      ...
>      - name: BasketUrl
>        valueFrom:
>          configMapKeyRef:
>            name: urls
>            key: BasketUrl
>```

# Setting eShopOnContainers up on Kubernetes (in Azure Container Service)

## Prerequisites
To create an Azure Container Service cluster using the Azure CLI 2.0, you must:
* Have an **Azure subscription account** ([get a free Azure trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/))
* A Docker development environment (based on [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)) with `docker` and `docker-compose`. You should already have this environment if you were already testing eShopOnContainers on Docker. Other than that:
    * Visit [docker.com](https://docker.com) to download the tools and set up the environment. Docker's [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_one/#step-3-verify-your-installation) covers verifying your Docker installation.
* Have installed and set up the Azure CLI 2.0 (Explained in the next step)

* Installing Azure CLI 2.0
If you don't have Azure CLI installed, install it following these steps: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
Once Azure CLI is installed, test it by simply writing "az" and hitting enter on your PowerShell:
<img src="img/azure-cli/azure-cli-test.png">

    Next, to verify the installation was successful, run `az --version` from your command line.
    You should see the version number of Azure CLI and other dependent libraries installed on your computer.

## Manually creating a Kubernetes cluster in ACS (Azure Container Service) and Azure environment
As optional procedure, you can manually create your Kubernetes cluster and Azure Container Registry, as in the following links:
* A Kubernetes cluster. Follow Azure Container Service's [walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough) to create one. 
* A private Docker registry. Follow Azure Container Registry's [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal) to create one.

However, unless you want to spend more time learning, step by step, focusing on how to create an ACS cluster and ACR, it is recommended to create those prerequisites with the scripts in the following procedure, as it'll be much quicker for you to set it up.

## Automatically creating the Azure environment with a PowerShell script provided by eShopOnContainers

Under the folder **k8s** in the root folder of eShopOnContainers solution, you can run the **gen-k8s-env.ps1** PowerShell script (from eShopOnContainers) to automatically create the Azure environment needed for a Kubernetes deployment. 
Here is the script to create the Kubernetes cluster in ACS plus the Script and metadata definition for eShopOnContainers to deploy it into the Kubernetes cluster:
<img src="img/kubernetes/kubernetes-scripts.png">
Steps to follow:

1. Make sure you have **Azure CLI 2.0** or later version installed on your dev machine. If you don't have it installed, follow the previous section that explained it.

2. **Login in Azure through Azure CLI.** Log in to Azure using a work or school account or a Microsoft account identity - Use the azure login command with either type of account identity to authenticate through Azure Active Directory. Most customers creating new Azure deployments should use this method. With certain accounts, the azure login command requires you to log in interactively through a web portal, as shown in the screenshot below.
Type the following in your command prompt:
    >```
    >az login
    >```
    <img src="img/azure-cli/az-login-1.png">

    Also use the azure login command to authenticate a service principal for an Azure Active Directory application, which is useful for running automated services.

    After logging in with a supported account identity, you can use either Azure Resource Manager mode or Azure Service Management mode CLI commands. 

3. **Select your Azure subscription** You might have [several Azure subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/account#set) as shown if you type the following.
    >```
    >az account list
    >```
    If you have multiple subscription accounts, you first need to select the Azure subscription account you want to target. Type the following:
    >```
    >az account set --subscription "Your Azure Subscription Name or ID"
    >```
    <img src="img/azure-cli/set-azure-subscription-default-to-target.png">
    <p>

3. **Run the gen-k8s-env.ps1 script**. This will create the Azure environment needed. Basically a Kubernetes cluster where to deploy de containers and an Azure Container Registry where you will push the images in the first place. Make sure that you are positioned in the folder at the PowerShell prompt (like [eShopOnContainers folder]\k8s), the run the following command but with your own names and IDs.

    >```
    >./gen-k8s-env -resourceGroupName eShopAutogenk8sResGroup -location westus -registryName eShopAutogenContainerRegistry -orchestratorName eshop-autogen-k8s-cluster -dnsName eshop-autogen-k8s-dns
    >```

    The execution should be similar to the following screenshot. It will take a few minutes to complete:
    <img src="img/kubernetes/creating-kubernetes-cluster-and-acr.png">

    At the end of that execution you will see the passwords generated for your Azure Container Registry. Copy those passwords so you can use it later (and change it later, if you wish).

    You can see in Azure's portal how the ACS-Kubernetes cluster was created with its basic information, such as the Master FQDN: 
eshop-autogen-k8s-dns.westus.cloudapp.azure.com 
    
    <img src="img/kubernetes/kubernetes-cluster-in-azure-portal.png">
    <p>
    <p>
4. **Install the Kubernetes command line client**, `kubectl`.
    * You can install `kubectl` with `az acs kubernetes install-cli` as in the following screenshot (use 'sudo' if in a Mac or Linux). (You can also download it from the [Kubernetes site](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/))
    <img src="img/kubernetes/install-kubernetes-cli.png">
    By default, this command installs the `kubectl` binary to `C:\Program Files (x86)\kubectl.exe` on Windows or to `/usr/local/bin/kubectl` on a Linux or macOS system. To specify a different installation path, use the `--install-location` parameter.
    After `kubectl` is installed, add its directory in your system path. MAke sure you access to its path by typing `kubectl version` as in the following screenshot:
    <img src="img/kubernetes/kubernetes-cli-version.png">
    
    * For further info about `az` tool and Kubernetes see the Azure Container Service [walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough). 
    * `az` is also helpful for getting the credentials `kubectl` needs to access your cluster. For other installation options, and information about configuring `kubectl` yourself, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubectl/install/).


## Deploying eShopOnContainers to Kubernetes in ACS (Azure Container Service) with the deployment script
We have simplified the deployment so you can do it just by executing a script by following the following few steps:

1. Open a PowerShell command line at the `k8s` directory of your local eShopOnContainers repository.
2. Ensure `docker`, `docker-compose`, and `kubectl` are on the path, and configured for your Docker machine and Kubernetes cluster.
3. Run the `deploy.ps1` script. But you'll need to know your Azure Container Registry credentials first. The Docker username and password are provided by Azure Container Registry, and can be retrieved from the Azure portal. Optionally, ACR credentials can be obtained by running the following command:

>```
>az acr credential show -n eShopAutogenContainerRegistry
>```
<img src="img/kubernetes/acr-passwords.png">

Once the user and password are retrieved, run the following script for deployment, including your values and password. For example:
>```
>./deploy.ps1 -registry eshopautogencontainerregistry.azurecr.io -dockerUser eShopAutogenContainerRegistry -dockerPassword YourSuperSecretPassword
>```
<img src="img/kubernetes/deploying-eshop-to-kubernetes-cluster.png">

The script will build the .NET Core code, SPA TypeScript code and corresponding Docker images, push the latter to your registry at Azure Container Registry, and deploy the application to your cluster. 

While deploying eShopOnContainers with the script, you can see the Docker image repositories being created in your **Azure Container Registry** which happens right before deploying to Kubernetes, at the Azure's portal:
<img src="img/kubernetes/azure-container-service-repos.png">

You can also watch the deployment unfold from the Kubernetes web interface by running `kubectl proxy` in a different PowerShell or bash window and open a browser to [http://localhost:8001/ui](http://localhost:8001/ui) as in the following screenshot:

<img src="img/kubernetes/kubernetes-admin-ui-01.png">

Finally you can test the web applications at the URLs told at the end of the script's execution, like:
>```
>WebSPA is exposed at http://your_kubernetes_cluster_ip
>```

>```
>WebMVC at http://your_kubernetes_cluster_ip/webmvc
>```
You should be able to run the eShop MVC app like in the following screenshot (using your external IP for the cluster, of course)
<img src="img/kubernetes/eshop-mvc-web-running-on-kubernetes.png">
