DRAFT - TBD in further details.
Basically, the docker-compose needs to be using the "production/staging" config, with:

**docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d**

This is using the [docker-compose.prod.yml](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopOnContainers/blob/master/docker-compose.prod.yml) which is providing an specific external DNS or IP configured by default at the [.env file](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopOnContainers/blob/master/.env) as:

ESHOP_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP=192.168.88.248

You could override with values from environment variables from your runtime/shell, as well.
