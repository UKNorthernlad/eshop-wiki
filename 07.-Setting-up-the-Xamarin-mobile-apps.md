# Important Notes for the Xamarin app:
* When running the Xamarin app note that it can run in "Mock mode" so you won't need any connection to the microservices, so the data shown is "fake data" generated by the client Xamarin app.
* In order to really access the microservices/containers you'll need to deploy the containers following this ["production" deployment procedure for the containers ](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopOnContainers/wiki/09.-Deploying-eShopOnContainers-to-a-%22Production%22-environment) and then, provide the external IP of your dev machine or the DNS name or IP of the Docker Host you are using into the Xamarin app settings when NOT using the "mock mode".

# Guidance on Architecture patterns of Xamarin.Forms apps
The following book (early draft state) is being created aligned with this sample/reference Xamarin app.
