Check the following documentation in order to use the HealthChecks library:

**Implementing health checks in ASP.NET Core services**
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/implement-resilient-applications/monitor-app-health 

Also, there's a nice blog post on HealthChecks by @scottsauber 
https://scottsauber.com/2017/05/22/using-the-microsoft-aspnetcore-healthchecks-package/ 

HealthChecks will come as nugget package as part of ASP.NET Core 2.1.
