This environment means that you want to build/run by using the CLI (Command line interface plus PowerShell scripts and "docker-compose up/build" CLI).

Because in this environment you need to build the .NET projects from the dotnet CLI plus being able to build the docker images with docker-compose build, there are some SDKs that need to be available from the command line and you need to install them or configute them so commands are available from the cmd context.
