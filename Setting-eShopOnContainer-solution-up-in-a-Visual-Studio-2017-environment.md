## Overview of the application code
In this repo you can find a sample reference application that will help you to understand how to implement a microservice architecture based application using <b>.NET Core</b> and <b>Docker</b>.

The example business domain or scenario is based on an eShop or eCommerce which is implemented as a multi-container application. Each container is a microservice deployment (like the basket-microservice, catalog-microservice, ordering-microservice and the  identity-microservice) which are developed using ASP.NET Core running on .NET Core so they can run either on Linux Containers and Windows Containers.
The screenshot below shows the VS Solution structure for those microservices/containers and client apps.
- Open <b>eShopOnContainers.sln</b> for a solution containing all the projects (All client apps and services).
- Open <b>eShopOnContainers-ServicesAndWebApps.sln</b> for a solution containing just the server-side projects related to the microservices and web applications.
- Open <b>eShopOnContainers-MobileApps.sln</b> for a solution containing just the client mobile app projects (Xamarin mobile apps only).
